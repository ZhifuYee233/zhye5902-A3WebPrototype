## This readme explains how the web app prototype was iterated and why things designed like this.
### Things need to be iterated: First of all, the following is the original web interface prototype. After analyzing and criticizing it and combining the views of friends, I list the shortcomings of the design.

#### In terms of color, because the navigation bar is dark, the website looks a little dirty, and the logo is not so conspicuous. "I think you'd better use some bright colors", Rio（a friend in Engineer）said. In addition, I found that the Add button on the right bottom seems redundant. The initial reason is that when users browse down, they can't quickly go back to the top to add tasks, so I put a global add button. However, I realize that the function of vertical task display and duedate sorting makes the user focus on the task that is about to close the deadline. In fact, I hope the user can only focus on one task and not to be anxious when seeing lots of tasks below following with bad productivity.

#### I realize that I forgot to have functions let users to put the links of reading material, and I hope to add a feature to have all url open at the same time.

#### The use and interface of the task adding is terrible rough, at least things need to be added: return, submit/create, reading materials(copy and paste the url)...

#### The music player has too bright and strong color which could draw people's attentions and "I don't think displaying the words of the song is a good idea, because when I am listening to music while watching the song words, I will forget what I'm really doing like studying math." said by Slade WU(A student majored in physics).

#### The timer only has the functions of reset, start, and pause. It seems that it can not meet the user's needs. Add at least one function to skip the current stage. The user may not want to strictly follow the timer plan.

#### And the user may not even know the Pomodoro timer and do not know hot use. To those people they could very confused what's going to happen after 25min focus, and 5min break, Therefore, a brief timer description must be had.
