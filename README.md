# zhye5902-A3WebPrototype
## This readme explains how the web app prototype was iterated and why things designed like this.
### Things need to be iterated: First of all, the following is the original web interface prototype. After analyzing and criticizing it and combining the views of friends, I list the shortcomings of the design.

### In terms of color, because the navigation bar is dark, the website looks a little dirty, and the logo is not so conspicuous. "I think you'd better use some bright colors, Brown is not good:disappointed:", Slade WU（a friend in Engineer）said. 
### In addition, I found that the Add button on the right bottom seems redundant. The initial reason is that when users browse down, they can't quickly go back to the top to add tasks, so I put a global add button. However, I realize that the function of vertical task display and duedate sorting makes the user focus on the task that is about to close the deadline. In fact, I hope the user can only focus on one task and not to be anxious when seeing lots of tasks below following with bad productivity.

### I realize that I forgot to have functions let users to put the links of reading material, and I hope to add a feature to have all url open at the same time.

### The use and interface of the task adding is terrible rough, at least things need to be added: return, submit/create, reading materials(copy and paste the url)...

### The music player has too bright and strong color which could draw people's attentions and "I don't think displaying the words of the song is a good idea, because when I am listening to music while watching the song words, I will forget what I'm really doing like studying math	:worried:." said by Rio LEE(A student majored in physics).

### The timer only has the functions of reset, start, and pause. It seems that it can not meet the user's needs. Add at least one function to skip the current stage. The user may not want to strictly follow the timer plan.

### And the user may not even know the Pomodoro timer and do not know hot use. To those people they could very confused what's going to happen after 25min focus, and 5min break, therefore, it could have some changes once users jump to next stage on the timer, like changing colors?

### Moreover, There is a lack of interactive feedback in the web page. The web page lacks some basic controls on the timer, such as skipping(go to next stage). 
### Also, the interface of the music player needs to be improved, it is found that most of students do their own study while listening to music, the result obtained through oral asking and social media contact towards 5 more friends and family members. More importantly, I also found that the song-searching function enables students to listen to music they like, rather than music that is helpful to their learning motivation. one of the answerers, Slade suggested that "you should choose some music that can keep my learning state and environment alive without distracting me:thinking:."

## Iteration: By asking some users (high school and college students of the same age) to pull users into my design process, so I can see their insights. I conducted the following iterative design according to their feedback, preferences and opinions, including my personal reflection on the use process.

### It is finally choose a strong red color, because students with procrastinaton and low productivity easily lose energy, while red is a color full of passion. Also it makes the text more visible.

### Although music is an important part during students' process of working/study, it should not has much brighter tone that draw users' attentions. Also, as Rio wish, The song's line is removed due to that could distract users very seriously. However, I try to add my perference which is a rotating-CD effect which is cool I think, while it is agreed by Rio too.

### Once user clicks on the start, a light blue frame with current Song's name will slides up.

### This is the final effect.

### Timer had been done few changes because this functions was talked a little by users, therefore I made mainly two modifications like firstly, an arrow button can help users to skip the current stage of the pomotimer to next one. Also...

### I give two working status different colors, as you see the red with passion and pressure represents focusing mode, while the light green with relax represents the short break time.

### Users will receive a notification if they skip to next stage, so that, users who firstly use the pomotimer will know how this tool works.

### According to people's preference on color, most of my friends think the original brown is too bad, while suggest to use strong color like red.
### Below is the final effect.
